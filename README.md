# Maze-Solving-Using-Depth-First-Search-Algorithm-
Implemented Depth First Search Algorithm to
help a robot to reach the center of a maze.The robot needs to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores the
maze, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. The program is written in C++ and simulation is
done using third party library.
